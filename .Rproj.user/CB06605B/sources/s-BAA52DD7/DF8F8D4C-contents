### **Introduction**

This tutorial will show you how to create a heatmap in python using seaborn. However, we must first install the R package reticulate in order to run python code in R.

To install reticulate, use the code below:

```
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate) # load the package onto our current R session
```

### Loading Python Libraries

Luckily, I have a mac, so Python is already installed on my machine. Make sure you have Python in your machine for this package to access!

Now, let's import the seaborn python modules. The import() function helps to specify which Python libraries you would like to load into the current R session.

```
# install python packages
py_install('seaborn')

# import the python libraries
sns <- import("seaborn")
plt <- import("matplotlib.pyplot")
pd <- import("pandas")
```
### Seaborn Heatmap in R

Now that we're all setup, lets load an example dataset, ```gapminder```, which provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007, for each of 142 countries. The dataset is available at www.gapminder.org.

```
data_url = 'http://bit.ly/2cLzoxH'
gapminder = pd$read_csv(data_url)
print(head(gapminder,3))
```

sns$heatmap(r_to_py(data), fmt="g", cmap ='viridis')
```
