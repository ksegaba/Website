### **Introduction**

This tutorial will show you how to create a heatmap in python using seaborn. However, we must first install the R package reticulate in order to run python code in R.

To install reticulate, use the code below:

```{R}
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate) # load the package onto our current R session
```

### Loading Python Libraries

Luckily, I have a mac, so Python is already installed on my machine. Make sure you have Python in your machine for this package to access!

Now, let's import the seaborn python modules.

```{r}
# install python packages
# py_install('seaborn')
```

```{python}
# import the python libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

### Seaborn Heatmap in R

Now that we're all setup, lets load an example dataset, ```gapminder```, which provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007, for each of 142 countries. The dataset is available at www.gapminder.org.

```{python}
data_url = 'http://bit.ly/2cLzoxH'
gapminder = pd.read_csv(data_url)
print(gapminder.head(3))
```

Our data is tidy, so we need to convert the data to wider form to facilitate making the heatmap.
```{python}
data = pd.pivot_table(gapminder, values='lifeExp', index=['continent'], columns='year')
```

Now let's plot our heatmap!
```{python}
sns.heatmap(data, cmap="YlGnBu")
```
This heatmap shows the trends in life expectancy per continent. It appears that Oceania has the longest life expectancy and Asia has the most improved life expectancy over the years.
