      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a heatmap in python using seaborn. However, we must first install the R package reticulate in order to run python code in R.
To install reticulate, use the code below:
#install.packages(&amp;quot;reticulate&amp;quot;) library(reticulate) # load the package onto our current R session  Loading Python Libraries Luckily, I have a mac, so Python is already installed on my machine. Make sure you have Python in your machine for this package to access!</description>

      <description>Modeling Australia Climate Data: This project will focus on analyzing climate in Australia. Climate data for temperature and rainfall was gathered from the Australian Bureau of Meterology (BoM) at 5 major Australian cities: Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Canberra, and Melbourne. Minimum and maximum temperature in celsius was sourced from BoM Climate Data Online. The temperature dataset includes the variables city_name, data, temperature, temp_type (min, max), and site_name (weather station). The rainfall dataset contains the weather station_code and station_name, city_name, year, month, day, rainfall in millimeters, period (how many days rainfall was collected across), quality (certified quality or not), latitude, and longitude.</description>
